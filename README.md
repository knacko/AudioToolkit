# AudioToolkit

This was a former Android Play app that provided numerous useful tools and calculators when setting up a stereo. It was updated from around 2006 to 2012, and active until 2018. The free version had over 150k downloads, and the Pro version ($2) had about 7500 downloads. The APK is still available on some non-Play app stores. Search for AudioToolkit, or AudioToolkitPro (though no responsibility is taken for cracked APKs).

From the original Play Store description:

Tone generator
- Sine, square, triangle, sawtooth waves and linear, cubic, exponential sweeps and white, pink, blue noise.

Enclosure builder
 - Rectangular, wedge and circular enclosures, sealed or ported, calculates dimensions given the material thickness, volume and port specs

Enclosure response graph
- Determine the relative gain of the enclosure, based on the T/S specs of the subwoofer.

Crossover builder
- Gives values and schematics for crossovers given load and frequency (High, low, bandpass, narrow bandpass crossovers and Zobel filters).

Wire Gauge Calculator
 - Automatically calculate length, load, gauge  or number of runs by inputting 3 out of the 4. Also includes a list of wire specs for common gauges.

Decibel Meter
 - Calculate the relative decibel level around the device.
(PLEASE NOTE: This is limited by the hardware. The microphone is designed for capturing voices (300-3400Hz). Outside this range, the microphone is not as responsive.)

Amplifier gains calculator
- Given the rated specs of your amplifier, you can properly set your line output to eliminate any clipping.

Ohm's Law Calculator and Common Equations
- Calculate Voltage, Amperage, Wattage or Resistance by inputting 2 of the 4. Includes most common equations for car audio (components in circuits, area and volume of shapes, enclosure specs, waves, etc)

Resistor value finder
- A visual tool to calculate the resistor value given the resistor band

LED resistor calculator
- Find the correct resistor for an LED to run on any voltage circuit

Speaker wiring calculator
- Find the final load of any series/parallel speaker circuit, given the voice coils and impedance. Wiring diagrams for most common setups.
